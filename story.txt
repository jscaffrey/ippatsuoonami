	"Hi.  Do you come here often?"
	He looked up from his terminal screen, prepared to be annoyed at the disturbance.
	The disturbance was Laura, who flashed him a quick smile, pleased with herself for
catching him off guard.  She plunked down a hot cup of coffee beside him and wrapped her 
oversized cardigan more tightly around her waist.
	"I wasn't expecting you for another hour," he said, a little more cheerfully than he
intended.
	Her smile faded.  "How long have you been here?  You can take breaks, you know."  She
noticed his disheveled appearance.  The creases under his eyes were as deep as the 
wrinkles in his button-down shirt.
	"You know how it is," he said, "when you're close to your big break.  You didn't 
shower for a week when you discovered that defunct underground intranet in Shanghai."
	“How kind of you to bring that up.”
	He straightened out as she sat down across from him. She delicately pried open her coffee, a faint click as the white plastic detached from the paper cup. He watched her pour two creams through the steam.
	She looked up, “Oh, sorry.” She pushed some creamers over to him.
	“No thanks.”
	“Drink it black, huh?”
	“No calories that way.”
	“You don’t look like you have to worry about that.”
	“I look that way because I do.”
	She smiled. He looked down at his computer.

	He sighed.
